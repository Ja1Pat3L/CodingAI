"""
txt = st.text_area(
    "Text to analyze",
    "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of "
    "wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it "
    "was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the "
    "season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of "
    "despair, (...)",
    )

st.write(f'You wrote {len(txt)} characters.')
